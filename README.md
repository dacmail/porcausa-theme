* `grunt` — Compile the files in your assets directory and put it in js/ and css/ folders.
* `grunt prepare` — Move vendor assets from bower_components to assets folder (useful after `bower update`).
* `grunt watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `grunt build` — Compile/minimize assets and put it in js/ and css/ folders.

# Development mode

* Change WP_DEVELOPMENT_MODE to true in `inc/actions.php` to use files in assets folder without compiling.
